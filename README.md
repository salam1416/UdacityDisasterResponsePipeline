### Udacity Emergency Response Pipeline

This project is divided into three parts: 
1- ETL Pipeline
2- ML Pipeline
3- Flask App

The project will include a web app where an emergency worker can input a new message and get classification results in several categories. The web app will also display visualizations of the data. This project will show off your software skills, including your ability to create basic data pipelines and write clean, organized code!

### Instructions on how to run the project:
1. Run the following commands in the project's root directory to set up your database and model.

    - To run ETL pipeline that cleans data and stores in database
        `python data/process_data.py data/disaster_messages.csv data/disaster_categories.csv data/DisasterResponse.db`
    - To run ML pipeline that trains classifier and saves
        `python models/train_classifier.py data/DisasterResponse.db models/classifier.pkl`

2. Run the following command in the app's directory to run your web app.
    `python run.py`

3. Go to http://0.0.0.0:3001/
